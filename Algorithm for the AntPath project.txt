   Description: Program has to loop throup 2D array and print the path of an ANT. Ant will take the path with the 
                lowest pheromone levels. The output should show the Ant calonies that was visited. 



1. Declare enum for ant colonies.
2. Create a Function that will generate random numbers 1 - 20 and fill it to 2D array
   
   * This function should iterate through the array and fill it with randomly generated number
   * Use for loop
3. Create a Function that will print out the 2D array
    
   * Iterate through 2D array and print it out to the screen
   * Make the design to look good for the user to understand the way Ant chose the path
4. Create a Function that checks whether the colony was visited

   * For this create 1D array 
   * Iterate through the columns and find the lowest
   * Do it for every row
5. Create a Function that will print out the path of the ANT to the user

   * Using switch and Enum values print out the path
   * It should change every time user runs the program
   * Make sure the design looks good

6. Inside main function, declare the variables and give the function arguments. 

   * Think about the arguments needs to be given.
